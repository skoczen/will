Meet Will.

Will is the friendliest, easiest-to-teach bot you've ever used.  He works on Slack, Hipchat, Rocket.chat, and more - so you can build your bot without platform lock-in.

He makes teaching your chat bot this simple:

```python
@respond_to("hi")
def say_hello(self, message):
    self.say("oh, hello!")
```

The first version of Will was built by [Steven Skoczen](http://stevenskoczen.com) while in the Greenkahuna Skunkworks (now defunct), was extended by [Ink and Feet](https://inkandfeet.com) and has been [contributed to by lots of awesome people](http://skoczen.github.io/will/improve/#the-shoulders-of-giants).

Will has docs, including a quickstart and lots of screenshots at:
**[http://skoczen.github.io/will/](http://skoczen.github.io/will)** 

If you've been using Will 0.x or 1.x, and are wondering how to upgrade to 2.x, [here's our friendly guide](http://skoczen.github.io/will/upgrading_to_2/). :)
