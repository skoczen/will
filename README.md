Meet Will.

Will is the friendliest, easiest-to-teach bot you've ever used.  He works on hipchat, in rooms and 1-1 chats.

He makes teaching your chat bot this simple:

```python
@respond_to("hi")
def say_hello(self, message):
    self.say("oh, hello!")
```

The hipchat Will was first built by [Steven Skoczen](http://stevenskoczen.com) while in the Greenkahuna Skunkworks (now defunct), was extended by [Ink and Feet](https://inkandfeet.com), and has been [contributed to by lots of awesome people](http://skoczen.github.io/will/improve/#the-shoulders-of-giants).

Will has docs, including a quickstart and lots of screenshots at:

Check them out!


**Next Release** 0.9.4 is scheduled for April 25, 2017.  Please test your integrations against master, and report any bugs!
