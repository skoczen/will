# Meet Will

Will is the friendliest, easiest-to-teach bot you've ever used.  He works on Slack, HipChat, Rocket.Chat, and more.

He makes teaching your chat bot this simple:

```
@respond_to("hi")
def say_hello(self, message):
    self.say("oh, hello!")
```

Lots of batteries are included, and you can get your own will up and running in a couple of minutes.  

Will started by [Steven Skoczen](http://www.inkandfeet.com), and has been [contributed to by lots of folks](improve.md#the-shoulders-of-giants).

Check out the quickstart below!

# Quickstart

**Upgrading from Will 1.x or 0.x? [Check out the Upgrade Guide](/upgrading_to_2/).**

Here's how to set up your system and get will running.  If you already write python, it'll probably take less than 5 minutes.

---

## Install prerequisites

Will doesn't need much, just python, a place to store things, and a way to communicate.

Will can store stuff in Redis, Couchbase, or local storage.  Our recommended backend is redis, and we'll describe getting it set up below. [Information on using Couchbase or local storage is here](deploy.md#Storage-Backends).

Will's communication layer works via publish-subscribe, and at the moment, only supports Redis.  If that's a blocker for you, ZeroMQ, and a pure python built-in layer are coming in 2.1.

#### Install redis > 2.4

Official documentation is at [redis.io](http://redis.io/).

If you're on Mac OS X, and using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/), you can simply:

```bash
brew install redis
```

On a Redhat (RHEL, Centos, Fedora) machine you can:

```bash
sudo yum install redis
sudo service redis enable
sudo service redis start
```

On a Debian (Ubuntu, Mint, KNOPPIX) machine to properly install follow the [Redis Quickstart](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart). But you can start more quickly with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install redis-server
redis-server
```

#### Install python > 2.6

Most modern operating systems (Mac OS X, Linux, BSDs, etc) ship with python installed, but if you don't have it, all the info is at [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

#### Install virtualenv

Virtualenv is a tool that lets you keep different python projects separate. It is highly recommended for will (and all other python development!)

The python guide has [a great tutorial on virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/), if you don't already have it running.  I'd recommend installing the excellent `virtualenvwrapper` library it mentions as well.

#### Set up a virtualenv for will

If you are using virtualenv wrapper:

```bash
$ mkproject my_will
# ... some output, setting up the virtualenv
$ workon my_will
(my_will) $ 
```

You're now all ready to install will!



## Get will running locally

#### Setting up the project

Installing will is simple easy.  Ready? Go!

From your virtualenv and the folder you want to set up your will in,

```bash
(my_will) $ pip install will
# ... output from a bunch of pip libraries installing

(my_will) $ generate_will_project
# ... output from will making your new project

(my_will) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
# ... install any needed libraries for your chosen backends.

(my_will) $ ./run_will.py
# .. the magic begins
```

That's it!

Note that the first time you run, you'll probably be missing some configuration. That's OK - `run_will` will check your environment, and walk you through getting and setting any necessary config.  We'll go through the nitty-gritty later, but if you have any odd setup problems, look in `config.py` - that's where all of the non-sensitive data is stored.

![Uninitialized Environment output](img/uninitialized_env.gif)
This is totally normal output.

Eventually, you'll reach this screen of joy.  Now, it's time to play!

![Screen of Joy](img/screen_of_joy.gif)

You can also use `generate_will_project` with the `--backends {Slack,HipChat,Rocket.chat,Shell}` option.

#### Testing will out

Once your will is up and running, hop into any of your chat rooms (or just the terminal), and say hello!

`@will hi`

![Hi, Will](img/hi.gif)

`@will help`

![Help, will](img/help.gif)

You're up and running - now it's time to [teach your will a few things](plugins/basics.md)!
