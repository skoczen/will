# Making Will Better and Better

Will is built entirely on the shoulders of giants, and has a great community of developers that move it forward. He wouldn't exist without all of them.

We also welcome new contributions no matter how big or small.  Interested in contributing to will? We'd love to have you. Details below.


## Our Culture

Anyone is welcome to contribute to will, regardless of skill level or experience.  To make will the best he can be, we have one big, overriding cultural principle:

**Be kind.**

Simple.  Easy, right?

We've all been newbie coders, we've all had bad days, we've all been frustrated with libraries, we've all spoken a language we learned later in life.  In discussions with other coders, PRs, and CRs, we just give each the benefit of the doubt, listen well, and assume best intentions.  It's worked out fantastically.

This doesn't mean we don't have honest, spirited discussions about the direction to move will forward, or how to implement a feature.  We do.  We just respect one other while we do it.  Not so bad, right? :)


## Improve will's core

For big core features, you're probably best off opening an issue, and discussing it with one of the core developers *before* you hack your nights and weekends away.

Core changes to will are very much welcome.  In some cases, proposed changes have already been thought through, and there may be gotchas or sticking points we couldn't get past.  In other cases, it might be a direction we've purposely decided not to take will.  In most cases, we simply haven't thought of it, and would love the improvement!

It's always great to get a heads up of what's coming down the pipe, and have an open dialog.  Thanks for reaching out and starting one!

In terms of the mechanics, you'll just want to:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone down a copy, set up redis and the env, as before.
3. Run `./start_dev_will.py` to start up just core will.

## Contribute new plugins

This one's pretty simple. Write good, clean code that does one thing well, document it properly, and submit a PR!

To submit a plugin that's running in your will,


1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone down a copy, set up redis and the env, as before.
3. `pip install -r requirements.dev.txt`
4. Copy your plugin and docs over to the core will repo,
5. Run `./start_dev_will.py` to start up just core will, and test it out!


## Code standards and PRs

This one's hopefully straightforward:

- Incoming code should follow PEP8
- If you add new core-level features, please add documentation in the `docs` folder (we use mkdocs).  If you're not sure if they're needed, just ask!
- Please add your name and attribution to the AUTHORS file.
- Know you have our thanks for helping to make will even better!


## Tests

Shamefully, tests are just getting rolling, and a proper, well-architected test harness is in the works. However, there are *some* tests you can run by running:

```bash
coverage run -m nose
```

More soon!


## The Shoulders of Giants

## Releases


#### 2.0 - ???

TODO: Finish these
Huge rewrite, adding pluggable backends for chat systems as well as Will's internal brains.  A huge number of really smart people gave their thoughts and suggestions throughout the process, not least @hobson, @woohgit, @netjunki, @sivy, @antgel, @shadow7412, @brandonsturgeon, @pepedocs, @tophsic

Here's what's new:

- Slack support
- CLI/Shell backend
- [Rocket.chat](https://rocket.chat/) support, thanks to [antgel](https://github.com/antgel)
- Lots more intelligence around required settings and verification, to make first starting and debugging Will easier.


This release also changes a few bits of behavior, to be consistent:
- `admin_only` is explicitly flagged for deprecation and removal, to be replaced by the ACL system introduced in 2015 (largely, this is because having two different access control systems is crazy and painful.)  Switching is as easy as adding `ACL = {'admins': ['steven', 'will']}` to your config.py and find/replacing `admin_only=True` with `acl=['admins',] in your codebase.  For now, Will handles backwards compatability by mapping the old settings into the new places, but he won't forever.  Thanks for updating, and making ongoing maintenence simpler!
- If no ACLs are specified and users try to perform restricted commands, they'll be allowed as before, but Will will complain to the console. A new `DISABLE_ACL` setting has been added to turn off the complaining.

This release addresses a number of bugs and smaller features, including:

* Chatoms support fixed by [bykof](https://github.com/bykof).
* Friendlier world time output.

#### 1.0.1 - October 10, 2017

#### 1.0.0 - September 29, 2017

**This is the end of major feature development for the hipchat-only version of Will.  Future development will be on 2.x, and while backwards compatability will be aimed for, it's not 100% guaranteed.**

Fixes and features in this release:

* Makes ACLs be case-insensitive, thanks to [woohgit](https://github.com/woohgit).

* New optional `WILL_LOGLEVEL` setting, thanks to [dpoirier](https://github.com/dpoirier).


#### 0.4.8 - May 21, 2014

* Will now ignores all previously sent messages properly, by passing in `bot` as the resource instead of an ugly time hack, thanks to [dpoirier](https://github.com/dpoirier).


#### 0.4.7 - May 15, 2014

* Will now prints a helpful message if one of your `WILL_ROOMS` is wrong, and continues starting, instead of crashing in a fiery ball, thanks to [crccheck](https://github.com/crccheck).


#### 0.4.6 - May 5, 2014

* `@route` decorators now honor all bottle arguments, most helpfully `method`!


#### 0.4.5 - May 2, 2014

* Awesome new help system by [quixeybrian](https://github.com/quixeybrian).
* "@will help" now only displays functions with docstrings, and formats them nicely.
* Old help (regexes and all) is available at "@will programmer help"


#### 0.4.4 - April 22, 2014

* Removes the dependence on the v1 token (though it still helps with rate-limiting), thanks to [bfhenderson](https://github.com/bfhenderson).
* Much friendlier error message on an invalid API key, thanks to [adamgilman](https://github.com/adamgilman).

#### 0.4.3 - ~ April 1, 2014

* Support for hundreds of users and rooms without hitting the API limit.
* `get_all_users` use of the bulk API [added](https://github.com/greenkahuna/will/pull/18) by [quixeybrian](https://github.com/quixeybrian).  Thanks also to [jbeluch](https://github.com/jbeluch) and [jdrukman](https://github.com/jdrukman) for nudges in the right direction.
* The start of some useful comments - the meat of will was hacked out by one person over a handful of days and it looks that way. Slowly but surely making this codebase more friendly to other contributions!
* Added a CONTRIBUTING.md file thanks to [michaeljoseph](https://github.com/michaeljoseph).
* Proper releases in the docs, and an updated `AUTHORS` file.  If you see something awry, send a PR!

#### 0.4 - ~ March 2014

* Ye olden past before we started keeping this list.  All contributions by GreenKahuna.  Will did everything that's not in the release list above.  That's called lazy retconning release lists!


- Make sure nothing from the readme is missed.
